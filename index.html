                    This project was completed during the Fall 2020 semester of Advanced Web Design at Columbia University, a course centered around utilizing interdisciplinary skills to develop software in the interest of the public. Thus, a central concept of the class involved creating our own definition of <span class = "bolder">Public Interest Technology.</span> <br> <br>
                    Throughout the design process we defined ‘Public Interest Technology’ as an alternative vision of technology developed to empower users to promote their own interests. <br> <br>
                    Technology is known to spread misinformation, accentuate discriminatory practices, perpetuate injustices, and allow for misuse of power and data. It is our shared belief that Public Interest Technology must avoid these pitfalls to become an engine of social and economic autonomy. <br> <br>
                    Pubic Interest Technology requires thoughtful design and focus on providing dedicated community leaders with the tools and know-how to take control of their digital lives.

                Clearfork Valley is currently mitigating the institutional impacts of the long, exploitative history of the mining industry. Despite many challenges, <span class = "bolder">Clearfork remains resilient with a thriving Appalachian culture and hope in the potential of reliable internet access. </span><br> <br>

The community has improved access to internet through  newly installed <span class = "bolder">Portable Network Kits.</span> This new design not only supports existing community efforts, but also expands on the off-grid applications available on the PNK through an improved user interface and new archiving platform. <br> <br>

Community members and visitors to Clearfork are able to share, preserve and explore the history and culture of Clearfork on a local network with easily navigable functionality. The updates to the PNK is a mechanism for empowerment, that looks <span class = "bolder">“beyond the goal of simply connecting people to the internet.” </span>

                        The archive should eventually allow those outside of Clearfork, especially those from the
                        community who moved away, to access the archive’s contents via the web.

                        This feature ensures that archive participants stay in control of their data, allowing them
                        to decide if their entries should be made available online or remaing local.

                        To best accomodate this data, an interactive, local network-based mapping tool could be
                        created. However, this is currently beyond the features of the Wordpress currently being
                        used on the PNK.

            For Engagement stage of the design process, we were working with a community that has low access to
            reliable internet. Fortunately, we were able to work with CTNY and their ethnographer, who had already
            engaged with the local community. Having a knowledgeable partner to help with engagement was of
            paramount importance to the project.
            On the definition stage, we had many discussions about unintended consequences around data, privacy, and
            misinformation. With that in mind, we came to the decision with our partners to have an administrator
            moderate archive posts. We also thought it was necessary to have the community have control over the
            archive data.

            The PIT design process allowed for many opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing, which
            ultimately led to a richer final design. With a heavy focus on participation, following the process led
            us to work hand and hand with our partner (CTNY), the community (through April), and an outside expert
            (Jason from LibraryBox). Through this we were more aware of the issue of accessibility and ensuring that
            people were not unintentially excluded.
