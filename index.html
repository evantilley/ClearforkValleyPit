                        This feature ensures that archive participants stay in control of their data, allowing them
                        to decide if their entries should be made available online or remaing local.

            For Engagement stage of the design process, we were working with a community that has low access to
            reliable internet. Fortunately, we were able to work with CTNY and their ethnographer, who had already
            engaged with the local community. Having a knowledgeable partner to help with engagement was of
            paramount importance to the project.
            On the definition stage, we had many discussions about unintended consequences around data, privacy, and
            misinformation. With that in mind, we came to the decision with our partners to have an administrator
            moderate archive posts. We also thought it was necessary to have the community have control over the
            archive data.

            The PIT design process allowed for many opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing, which
            ultimately led to a richer final design. With a heavy focus on participation, following the process led
            us to work hand and hand with our partner (CTNY), the community (through April), and an outside expert
            (Jason from LibraryBox). Through this we were more aware of the issue of accessibility and ensuring that
            people were not unintentially excluded.
