                For Engagement stage of the design process, we were working with a community that has low access to reliable internet. Fortunately, we were able to work with CTNY and their ethnographer, who had already engaged with the local community. Having a knowledgeable partner to help with engagement was of paramount importance to the project. 
                On the definition stage, we had many discussions about unintended consequences around data, privacy, and misinformation. With that in mind, we came to the decision with our partners to have an administrator moderate archive posts. We also thought it was necessary to have the community have control over the archive data.

                The PIT design process allowed for many opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing, which ultimately led to a richer final design. With a heavy focus on participation, following the process led us to work hand and hand with our partner (CTNY), the community (through April), and an outside expert (Jason from LibraryBox).  Through this we were more aware of the issue of accessibility and ensuring that people were not unintentially excluded.
